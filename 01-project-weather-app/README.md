## 🌐 How to Use the OpenWeatherMap API

To fetch real-time weather data, this app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API**. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Create an Account**  
   Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Get Your API Key**  
   After signing up, you'll receive a personal API key. **Save this key**, you’ll need it to make requests.

3. **Go to Current Weather Data**  
   Navigate to the **API** menu and click on **Current Weather Data**.

4. **Find the City Name Request URL**  
   Scroll to the section titled **"Built-in API request by city name"** and copy the sample URL.

5. **Customize the API URL**  
   - Replace `appid={API key}` with **your actual API key**.  
   - Replace `q={city name}` with the **city you want to get weather data for**.

6. **Try the URL in Your Browser**  
   Paste the customized URL into your browser. If it doesn’t work right away, wait a few minutes — new API keys may take a little time to activate.

7. **Use Metric Units**  
   To show the temperature in Celsius, append `&units=metric` to the end of the URL.  
   
That's it! You're now ready to display live weather information in your app. 🌦️
